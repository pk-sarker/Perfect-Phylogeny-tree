Implementation of Perfect Phylogeny Tree with C
-----------------
|    PROBLEM    |
-----------------

-------
Implement the algorithm for testing if a character-state matrix, with 2 states for each character,

admits a prefect phylogeny. When it does, display the phylogeny tree. Even when it doesn't, you can

display the phylogeny tree for the first i<=i<=m compatible characters. 



 --------------------
 |   Test Input     |
 -------------------- 
 Number of Taxon(n) : 5
 
 Number of Characters in each Taxon (m): 5
 
  
  Taxon 1 = 1 1 0 0 0
  
  Taxon 2 = 0 0 1 0 0
  
  Taxon 3 = 1 1 0 0 1
  
  Taxon 4 = 0 0 1 1 0
  
  Taxon 5 = 0 1 0 0 0
